A portfolio website where I showcase my best recent work/applications.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
The aim of this project was to create my first portfolio website using HTML and CSS, and implementing flexbox and/or CSS grid. I decided on using flexbox only for this, but hope to implement grid in the future. I also used some pseudo class selectors for the first time, and some new properties. 

## Usage

To use the website, you have to click the following link, and feel free to use the navigation on the top of the page to see different sections of the page. I have also included links in the footer with social media contact details.
